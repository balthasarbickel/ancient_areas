## Files and directories

- `detecting_ancient_areasBickel2015.R` is generated from the Sweave (`.Rnw`) file in which the paper was originally written. 

- The directory `SOM` (Supporting Online Material) contains all data and scripts on which the summary analyses in `detecting_ancient_areasBickel2015.R` depend on. Note that the scripts `trans.pacific.fbtest.*.R` took along time to run in 2015. 

Note that all analyses are based on a 2015 pre-release version of AUTOTYP. Since then we cleaned up, corrected, revised and expanded the database in virtually all respects. The database is now available at [https://github.com/autotyp/autotyp-data](https://github.com/autotyp/autotyp-data).
